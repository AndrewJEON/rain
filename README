example tests:
./rain ./tests/two_threads_unbalanced 4 7
./rain ./tests/many_threads_unbalanced
./rain ./tests/deadlock
./rain ./tests/nodeadlock

two_threads_unbalanced takes two arguments which correspond to how long two threads should run in seconds
many_threads_unbalanced takes no arguments and spawns two threads to spawn worker threads which run for random number of seconds
