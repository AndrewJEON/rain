example tests:
./rain ./inbalanced_sum 4 7
./rain ./many_threads_unbalanced
./rain ./deadlock
./rain ./nodeadlock

inbalanced_sum takes two arguments which correspond to how long two threads should run in seconds
many_threads_unbalanced takes no arguments and spawns two threads to spawn worker threads which run for random number of seconds
